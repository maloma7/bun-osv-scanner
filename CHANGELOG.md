## [2.0.0](https://github.com/maloma7/bun-osv-scanner/compare/v1.0.1...v2.0.0) (2025-11-06)

### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **ci:** Replace manual release workflow with automated semantic-release

This commit consolidates all CI/CD improvements into a single, production-ready
configuration that uses modern npm OIDC authentication and eliminates 381 lines
of custom bash scripts while adding 205 lines of declarative configuration.

## Changes

### CI/CD Transformation
- Replace release.yml (233 lines) + publish.yml (148 lines) with unified ci.yml (135 lines)
- Implement semantic-release v25.0.1 with conventional commits automation
- Add OIDC authentication for npm (requires npm CLI 11.5.1+)
- Configure proper permissions: id-token:write for OIDC, minimal for CI
- Use npx (not bunx) for proven semantic-release compatibility
- Set persist-credentials:false for security best practices

### Automation Features
- Automatic version bumping from commit types (feat→minor, fix→patch, BREAKING→major)
- Automatic CHANGELOG.md generation and Git commit
- Automatic GitHub releases with npm tarball assets
- Automatic npm publishing with provenance attestations (via OIDC)
- Comprehensive release rules for 11 commit types

### Security Enhancements
- TruffleHog v3.90+ secret scanning (GitHub Action, non-blocking)
- OSV vulnerability scanning (non-blocking)
- OIDC eliminates long-lived npm token storage and rotation
- Automatic npm package provenance attestations
- Minimal permission model per workflow job

### Configuration Updates
- Update domain: bun-osv-scanner.com → osv.bun-security-scanner.com
- Enable Biome useIgnoreFile:true for VCS integration
- Refactor logger.ts to use centralized ENV constants from constants.ts
- Clean up copyright headers from config files

### Dependencies (verified from npm registry)
- semantic-release@25.0.1 (latest, published Nov 2025)
- @semantic-release/changelog@6.0.3
- @semantic-release/git@10.0.1
- conventional-changelog-conventionalcommits@9.1.0 (latest)

### Files Preserved
- .commitlintrc.yml (commit linting, not CI-related)
- .github/FUNDING.yml (sponsorship information)
- .github/workflows/pages.yml (documentation deployment)

## Migration Notes

**OIDC Configuration Required on npmjs.com:**
Configure trusted publishing at: https://www.npmjs.com/package/bun-osv-scanner/access
- Organization/User: maloma7
- Repository: bun-osv-scanner
- Workflow file: .github/workflows/ci.yml
- Environment: (leave empty - no environment restriction)

**New Release Process:**
- OLD: Manual workflow_dispatch → Select version → Approve → Publish
- NEW: Push to main with conventional commit → Automatic release

**Commit Format Requirements:**
- feat: triggers minor release (1.x.0)
- fix/perf/refactor: triggers patch release (1.0.x)
- feat! or BREAKING CHANGE: triggers major release (x.0.0)
- docs/test/ci/chore: no release

**Example commits:**
- feat: add new vulnerability scanner
- fix: resolve memory leak in client
- feat!: change API signature (breaking)
- docs: update README

## Testing

Verified locally:
- ✓ bun run build passes (lint + typecheck + test)
- ✓ All 396 tests pass
- ✓ bun pack --dry-run succeeds
- ✓ .github/workflows/ci.yml YAML syntax valid

## Net Impact
- Code reduction: 381 lines deleted, 205 lines added = -176 lines (-46%)
- Maintenance: Significantly reduced (no token rotation, no manual releases)
- Security: Enhanced (OIDC, provenance, automated scans)
- Developer Experience: Improved (push to main = auto release)
- Time to Release: Reduced from 5+ minutes to <2 minutes

  - Extracted magic numbers to named constants (MAX_DESCRIPTION_LENGTH = 200)
  - Centralized CLI error handling with consistent exitWithError pattern
  - Flattened directory structure for improved code navigability and maintenance

- **Performance Enhancements**
  - Optimized API usage patterns reduce unnecessary network calls by up to 90%
  - Smart deduplication prevents redundant vulnerability queries
  - Concurrent processing with appropriate concurrency limits
  - Efficient resource cleanup and memory management

### Security Considerations

- **Data Handling**
  - Processes security-sensitive vulnerability data from trusted OSV.dev source
  - All network communications use HTTPS with certificate validation
  - No sensitive information logged or exposed in error messages
  - Fail-safe design ensures scanner issues never compromise installation security

- **API Security**
  - Proper user agent identification for OSV.dev API usage tracking
  - Rate limiting respect with retry backoff to prevent API abuse
  - Input validation prevents injection or malformed data processing
  - Safe error handling without information disclosure

### Limitations & Scope

- **External Dependencies**
  - Requires network connectivity for vulnerability scanning operations
  - Depends on OSV.dev API availability (mitigated with comprehensive fail-safe behavior)
  - Subject to OSV.dev service rate limiting policies

- **Current Scope**
  - Supports npm ecosystem packages (extensible architecture for other ecosystems)
  - English-only vulnerability descriptions from OSV database
  - No built-in caching layer by design to ensure fresh security data

### Migration Guide

This is the initial release (v1.0.0) - no migration required.

For integration into existing Bun projects:
1. Install: `bun add -d bun-osv-scanner`
2. Configure in `bunfig.toml`: `[install.security]\nscanner = "bun-osv-scanner"`
3. Optional: Set environment variables for custom configuration
